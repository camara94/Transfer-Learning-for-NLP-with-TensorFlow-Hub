# Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

Welcome to this hands-on project on transfer learning for natural language processing with TensorFlow and TF Hub. By the time you complete this project, you will be able to use pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub, perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world data, build and evaluate multiple models for text classification with TensorFlow, and visualize model performance metrics with Tensorboard.

## Welcome!

Welcome to Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:
