# Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

Welcome to this hands-on project on transfer learning for natural language processing with TensorFlow and TF Hub. By the time you complete this project, you will be able to use pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub, perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world data, build and evaluate multiple models for text classification with TensorFlow, and visualize model performance metrics with Tensorboard.

## Project-based Course Overview
## Welcome!

Welcome to Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:


## Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

* Use pre-trained NLP text embedding models from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/)

* Perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world text data  

* Visualize model performance metrics with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
